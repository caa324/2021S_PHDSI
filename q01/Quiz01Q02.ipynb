    "A common, and important, task given to a biostatistician when running an experimental study is randomly assigning patients to one of two groups: a test group or a control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients enrolled in the test group and the control group should have simialr attributes. \n",
    "They should have a similar distributon of ages, BMIs, etc. \n",
    "And these two groups should have similar proportions of other attirbutes that may impact the outcome of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to, as best as possible, to make the only systematic difference between the two groups is the presence (or absence) of a medical intervention. \n",
    "The group that recieves the intervention is typically called the test group and the group of patients that do not receieve the intervention is typically called the control group. \n"
